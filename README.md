Logistic Regression and Random Forest prediction for a McKinsey Hackathon.

The challenge was to predict who out of a potential customer dataset had the largest probability of being accepted for 
a loan. The challenge included some data cleaning & preparation, feature engineering and finally I made
predictions using both a logit regression model and a random forest model. Due to the nature of my variables, the 
random forest had a slightly better predictive power.
